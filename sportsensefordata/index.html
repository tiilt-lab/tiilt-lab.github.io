            <p class="window__description">
              SportSense for Data Literacy is an 8 week sports and data curriculum for fifth-grade students. The intention of this curriculum is to support students in learning and practicing data processes via their personal physical movement. The overarching framework used throughout the curriculum was a four-stage data process that was introduced to students at the start of the unit. Lessons use the Play Impossible Gameball, micro:bit, and Scratch. Below you can find the lesson plans and materials for each week

      <h1>Week 1 - What do sensors do? / Power of Sensors</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        This lesson will introduce students to the power of sensors. We will think about our body’s senses as we move and jump. We will record these changes by counting our jumps. Then, we will visualize these jumps and discuss how we counted our jumps. What senses did we use to identify a jump? We hint at parallels between what our bodies sense and what sensors can detect.

      <h1>Week 2 - Why do sensors matter? / Sensor Enabled Play</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        This lesson will build on our understanding of sensors from week 1 by expanding why sensors matter. We will look at data recorded by the play-impossible game ball. We will continue to question the relationship between our movement and how that is recorded in the data. We will reflect on what different features in our data mean, and think about how to choose features that are important to us. We set up how data can be visualized and represented in different formats. This also may hint at how data is used to ask and answer questions about our movement and the ball’s movement.

      <h1>Week 3 - What do we use data for? / Getting to Know the micro:bit</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        Today we will explore the power of data by using it to identify patterns in our movement. We will use the micro:bit to record our data. We will visualize our movement data through makecode. We will consider how different parts of the data are better at showing different movement patterns. We begin to ask questions about our movement and reflect on how technology can help us answer these questions.

      <h1>Week 4 - How can we use patterns in data? / Scratch for Body and Facial Recognition</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        In this lesson, we continue with the micro:bit and introduce scratch video for thinking about what to do with the patterns we find in data. The focus of this lesson is on contextualizing the patterns we are seeing. We want to understand why these patterns matter to us, and begin to understand the questions that we can ask & answer with data.

      <h1>Week 5 - How do these parts work together? / Asking and Answering Questions</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        Today we consider how the steps we have used throughout the weeks come together. We will think about using a sensor, collecting data, identifying patterns, and interpreting patterns. We use this in an example to ask and answer a question with data. We will think about the process as a tool for asking and answering our own questions with data.

      <h1>Week 6 - Final Projects - Student Designing (Part 1)</h1>
      <p class="window__description">
        We will do some thinking about sports technologies and games to answer a question / solve a problem. We’ll look at some technologies made by some inventors, and then brainstorm something we might want to create as a project.
